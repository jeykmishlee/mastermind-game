PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION


Mastermind is an old code-breaking game played by two players. 
The game goes back to the 19th century and it resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century. 
The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. 
Usually, the mastermind game is color-coded but for this program, instead of using different colors, we represent it with different numbers.
